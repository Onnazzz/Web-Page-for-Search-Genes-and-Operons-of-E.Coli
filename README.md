# Web-Page-for-Search-Genes-and-Operons-of-E.Coli

Index.html is the script of the principal page of the web page. 

Image files are used either as buttons or solely for decoration. (Image credit goes to Rodrigo)

All other files have the different scripts to obtain the required data. 

For example:  

  -gene.php -> obtained the information of the gene.
  
  -seqg.php -> obtained the sequence of the gene.
  
  -style2.css -> is one of the three format pages we used. 


Objective: 

Learn to coding a web page to search genes and operons of E.coli.

  -Learn to use primarily PHP and HTML languages, as well as MySQL and JavaScript.
  
  -Understand how to link the web page to RegulonDB in order to retrieve the data.
